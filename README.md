# Little-Professor
The Little Professor Math Game is a Python program designed to simulate the experience of the classic "Little Professor" toy. It generates math problems for users to solve while encouraging learning through repetition and feedback. Users solve up to 10 randomly generated addition problems, with scores tracked and displayed at the end.
